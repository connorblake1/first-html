<h2>Connor's School Page</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time on school and take a lot of pride in my work. My grades are extremely important to me and I always try 
to keep them as high as possible. So far, my favorite classes have been Processing and Algebra II, but science has also been really interesting
to me this year. Here is a list of my favorite classes of the first semester, in order.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Processing</li>
	<li>Algebra II</li>
	<li>Biology</li>
	<li>Journalism</li>
	<li>Spanish</li>
	<li>English</li>
	<li>History</li>
</ol>
<p>Honestly, now that I think about it, my favorite classes are just the ones with the least work, but I still learn alot like Processing or Biology.</p>
