<h2>Connor's Quiz Bowl Page</h2>
<p>My favorite extracurricular is by far quiz bowl. In a game of quiz bowl, 4 players from each team compete to answer questions on topics
ranging from Russian literature to molecular biology. A lot of the topics are covered in school, but to be really successful, each player 
has to specialize in a subject not covered in school. <a href="qb2.html">Here</a> is more about studying for quiz bowl.</p>
<br />
At the end of each tournament, the host compiles the statistics from the rounds. Here is also a table of my personal statistics from this school year so far.
