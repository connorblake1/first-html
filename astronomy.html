<h2>Connor's Astronomy and Photography Page</h2>
<p>Although I don't personally have a telescope or a nice camera,  I really like picture of stars and anything in the
night sky. For the past three or four years, all of my user icons and computer desktops have been pictures taken by
the Hubble Telescope or other large telescopes. My gmail icon, <img src="../Pictures/eagleNebula.png" width="50" /> has been the same picture for over 3 years now.
The night sky fascinates me just because of its vastness, so I have tried to take some pictures on my own.</p>

 <p>During the lunar eclipse on January 20, my mom and I set up her nice camera out in our backyard and snapped some shots of the moon as it
 turned blood red.</p>

<p>The zoom was not great, but it worked.

Back in late December, we were up in the moutains for a ski trip and after messing with some settings on my GoPro, I managed to capture the 
stars spinning over a portion of the Rocky Mountains over a thirteen hour period.</p>

<p>Obviously, these two pieces don't look great compared 12 megapixel Hubble masterpieces, but I really like them as a proof of concept of taking
pictures of the night sky. This is one of favorites that has been my desktop for a while of the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>
