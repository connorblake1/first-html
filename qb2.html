<h2>Connor's Quiz Bowl Studying Page</h2>
<p>To be successful in quiz bowl, you really have to know excessive amounts of information about a huge range of topics. To help study for 
tournaments, I have created 3 spreadsheets to hold some of my information on visual arts, poetry, and books.
<br />
The first one I made was about visual arts. Instead of having just 5 entries, this particular one currently holds 193 distinct works of art. In the actual
spreadsheet, I did not actually include pictures because that would be way too much work, but I did here. Here is a sample of it:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th style="width: 100px">Artist</th>
		<th style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">Medium</th>
		<th style="width: 125px">Title</th>
		<th style="width: 200px">Description</th>
		<th style="width: 300px">Picture</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Velazquez</td>
		<td rowspan="3">Painting</td>
		<td>Las Meninas</td>
		<td>girls and a painter in tall room, guy leaving</td>

<p>The second one I made was about poetry, and it looks quite similar to the visual arts one.</p>
<p>The most recent one I have made was about books and short stories. For a full version of this particular table, visit
